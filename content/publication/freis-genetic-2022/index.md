abstract: Executive functions (EFs) and intelligence (IQ) are phenotypically correlated.
  In twin studies, latent variables for EFs and IQ display moderate to high heritability
  estimates; however, they show variable genetic correlations in twin studies spanning
  childhood to middle age. We analyzed data from over 11,000 children (9- to 10-year-olds,
  including 749 twin pairs) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study
  to examine the phenotypic and genetic relations between EFs and IQ in childhood.
  We identified two EF factors—Common EF and Updating-Specific—which were both related
  to IQ (rs = 0.64–0.81). Common EF and IQ were heritable (53%–67%), and their genetic
  correlation (rG = 0.86) was not significantly different than 1. These results suggest
  that EFs and IQ are phenotypically but not genetically separable in middle childhood,
  meaning that this phenotypic separability may be influenced by environmental factors.
