abstract: 'The progression of lifelong trajectories of socioeconomic inequalities
  in health and mortality begins in childhood. Dysregulation in cortisol, a stress
  hormone that is the primary output of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis,
  has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for how early environmental adversity compromises
  health. However, despite the popularity of cortisol as a biomarker for stress and
  adversity, little is known about whether cortisol output differs in children being
  raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments. Here, we show that there
  are few differences between advantaged and disadvantaged children in their cortisol
  output. In 8–14-year-old children from the population-based Texas Twin Project,
  we measured cortisol output at three different timescales: (a) diurnal fluctuation
  in salivary cortisol (n = 400), (b) salivary cortisol reactivity and recovery after
  exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test (n = 444), and (c) cortisol concentration
  in hair (n = 1210). These measures converged on two moderately correlated, yet distinguishable,
  dimensions of HPA function. We tested differences in cortisol output across nine
  aspects of social disadvantage at the home (e.g., family socioeconomic status),
  school (e.g., average levels of academic achievement), and neighborhood (e.g., concentrated
  poverty). Children living in neighborhoods with higher concentrated poverty had
  higher diurnal cortisol output, as measured in saliva; otherwise, child cortisol
  output was unrelated to any other aspect of social disadvantage. Overall, we find
  limited support for alteration in HPA axis functioning as a general mechanism for
  the health consequences of socioeconomic inequality in childhood.'
