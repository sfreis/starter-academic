abstract: 'Extremist far-right ideologies, including scientifically inaccurate beliefs
  about race, are on the rise (Mieriņa and Koroļeva 2015; Youngblood 2020); individuals
  perpetuating such ideologies occasionally cite genetics research, including behavioral
  genetics research. This highlights the need for behavioral geneticists to actively
  confront extremist ideology and promote anti-racism. We emphasize the need for Diversity,
  Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committees within behavioral genetics institutions. DEI
  committees can lead to: greater awareness of ways in which behavioral genetics has
  been misused (historically and currently) to harm minoritized communities, increased
  discussions on conducting ethical behavioral genetics research, and increased collaboration
  for conducting more diverse behavioral genetics research. We discuss the activities
  and goals of the student-driven DEI committee at the Institute for Behavior Genetics
  (IBG). At the same time, we acknowledge we have a long way to go, both as a committee
  and as a field. Our committee is still in its early stages; we discuss challenges
  to increasing DEI in the field and present future goals for both IBG and the behavioral
  genetics community as we explore the process of implementing DEI work.'
