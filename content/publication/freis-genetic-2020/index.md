abstract: 'Preprint: Executive functions (EFs) and intelligence (IQ) are phenotypically
  correlated and heritable; however, they show variable genetic correlations in twin
  studies spanning childhood to middle age. We analyzed data from over 11,000 children
  (9-10-year-olds, including 749 twin pairs) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
  (ABCD) Study to examine the phenotypic and genetic relations between EFs and IQ
  in childhood. We identified two EF factors â€“ Common EF and Updating-Specific, which
  were both related to IQ (rs = .64-.81). Common EF and IQ were heritable (53-67%),
  and their genetic correlation (rG = .86) was not significantly different than 1.
  These results suggest that EFs and IQ are phenotypically but not genetically separable
  in middle childhood.'
