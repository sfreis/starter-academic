abstract: Executive functions (EFs) and impulsivity are dimensions of self-regulation
  that are both related to psychopathology. However, self-report measures of impulsivity
  and laboratory EF tasks typically display small correlations, and existing research
  indicates that impulsivity and EFs may tap separate aspects of self-regulation that
  independently statistically predict psychopathology in adulthood. However, relationships
  between EFs, impulsivity, and psychopathology may be different in childhood compared
  to adulthood. Here, we examine whether these patterns hold in the baseline assessment
  of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) sample, a national sample
  of over 11,000 children (including 749 twin pairs) ages 9â€“10 years. We examine the
  phenotypic and genetic relationships among latent variables for different components
  of EFs and multiple facets of impulsivity. Additionally, we assess how EFs and impulsivity
  relate to composite measures and latent variables of psychopathology derived from
  parent report. EFs were weakly correlated with impulsivity, and the strength varied
  by impulsivity facet, emphasizing their separability. We did not identify significant
  genetic and environmental correlations between EFs and impulsivity. Moreover, controlling
  for their small relationships with each other, both EFs and some facets of impulsivity
  statistically predicted an Externalizing factor, attention problems, and social
  problems, and twin analyses suggested these relationships were genetic in origin.
  These findings indicate that EFs and impulsivity represent phenotypically and genetically
  separable aspects of self-regulation that are both transdiagnostic correlates of
  psychopathology in childhood.
