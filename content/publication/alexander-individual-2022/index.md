abstract: Youth behavior changes and their relationships to personality have generally
  been investigated using self-report studies, which are subject to reporting biases
  and confounding variables. Supplementing these with objective measures, like GPS
  location data, and twin-based research designs, which help control for confounding
  genetic and environmental influences, may allow for more rigorous, causally informative
  research on adolescent behavior patterns. To investigate this possibility, this
  study aimed to (1) investigate whether behavior changes during the transition from
  adolescence to emerging adulthood are evident in changing mobility patterns, (2)
  estimate the influence of adolescent personality on mobility patterns, and (3) estimate
  genetic and environmental influences on mobility, personality, and the relationship
  between them. Twins aged Fourteen to twenty-two (N = 709, 55 % female) provided
  a baseline personality measure, the Big Five Inventory, and multiple years of smartphone
  GPS data from June 2016 - December 2019. Mobility, as measured by daily locations
  visited and distance travelled, was found via mixed effects models to increase during
  adolescence before declining slightly in emerging adulthood. Mobility was positively
  associated with Extraversion and Conscientiousness (r of 0.17–0.25, r of 0.10–0.16)
  and negatively with Openness (r of −0.11 - −0.13). ACE models found large genetic
  (A = 0.56–0.81) and small-moderate environmental (C of 0.12–0.28, E of 0.07–0.15)
  influences on mobility. A and E influences were highly shared across mobility measures
  (rg = 0.70, re = 0.58). Associations between mobility and personality were partially
  explained by mutual genetic influences (rg of −0.27–0.53). Results show that as
  autonomy increases during adolescence and emerging adulthood, we see corresponding
  increases in youth mobility. Furthermore, the heritability of mobility patterns
  and their relationship to personality demonstrate that mobility patterns are informative,
  psychologically meaningful behaviors worthy of continued interest in psychology.
