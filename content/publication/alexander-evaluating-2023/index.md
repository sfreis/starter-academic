abstract: IntroductionParental monitoring is a key intervention target for adolescent
  substance use, however this practice is largely supported by causally uninformative
  cross-sectional or sparse-longitudinal observational research designs.MethodsWe
  therefore evaluated relationships between adolescent substance use (assessed weekly)
  and parental monitoring (assessed every two months) in 670 adolescent twins for
  two years. This allowed us to assess how individual-level parental monitoring and
  substance use trajectories were related and, via the twin design, to quantify genetic
  and environmental contributions to these relationships. Furthermore, we attempted
  to devise additional measures of parental monitoring by collecting quasi-continuous
  GPS locations and calculating a) time spent at home between midnight and 5am and
  b) time spent at school between 8am-3pm.ResultsACE-decomposed latent growth models
  found alcohol and cannabis use increased with age while parental monitoring, time
  at home, and time at school decreased. Baseline alcohol and cannabis use were correlated
  (r = .65) and associated with baseline parental monitoring (r = −.24 to −.29) but
  not with baseline GPS measures (r = −.06 to −.16). Longitudinally, changes in substance
  use and parental monitoring were not significantly correlated. Geospatial measures
  were largely unrelated to parental monitoring, though changes in cannabis use and
  time at home were highly correlated (r = −.53 to −.90), with genetic correlations
  suggesting their relationship was substantially genetically mediated. Due to power
  constraints, ACE estimates and biometric correlations were imprecisely estimated.
  Most of the substance use and parental monitoring phenotypes were substantially
  heritable, but genetic correlations between them were not significantly different
  from 0.DiscussionOverall, we found developmental changes in each phenotype, baseline
  correlations between substance use and parental monitoring, co-occurring changes
  and mutual genetic influences for time at home and cannabis use, and substantial
  genetic influences on many substance use and parental monitoring phenotypes. However,
  our geospatial variables were mostly unrelated to parental monitoring, suggesting
  they poorly measured this construct. Furthermore, though we did not detect evidence
  of genetic confounding, changes in parental monitoring and substance use were not
  significantly correlated, suggesting that, at least in community samples of mid-to-late
  adolescents, the two may not be causally related.
