abstract: Objective Symptoms of psychopathology covary across diagnostic boundaries,
  and a family history of elevated symptoms for a single psychiatric disorder places
  an individual at heightened risk for a broad range of other psychiatric disorders.
  Both twin-based and genome-wide molecular methods indicate a strong genetic basis
  for the familial aggregation of psychiatric disease. This has led researchers to
  prioritize the search for highly heritable childhood risk factors for transdiagnostic
  psychopathology. Cognitive abilities that involve the selective control and regulation
  of attention, known as executive functions (EFs), are a promising set of risk factors.
  Method In a population-based sample of child and adolescent twins (n = 1,913, mean
  age = 13.1 years), we examined genetic overlap between both EFs and general intelligence
  (g) and a transdiagnostic dimension of vulnerability to psychopathology, comprising
  symptoms of anxiety, depression, neuroticism, aggression, conduct disorder, oppositional
  defiant disorder, hyperactivity, and inattention. Psychopathology symptoms in children
  were rated by children and their parents. Results Latent factors representing general
  EF and g were highly heritable (h2 = 86%−92%), and genetic influences on both sets
  of cognitive abilities were robustly correlated with transdiagnostic genetic influences
  on psychopathology symptoms (genetic r values ranged from −0.20 to −0.38). Conclusion
  General EF and g robustly index genetic risk for transdiagnostic symptoms of psychopathology
  in childhood. Delineating the developmental and neurobiological mechanisms underlying
  observed associations between cognitive abilities and psychopathology remains a
  priority for ongoing research.
