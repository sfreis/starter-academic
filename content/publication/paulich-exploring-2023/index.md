abstract: Previous research links risky sexual behavior (RSB) to externalizing problems
  and to substance use, but little research has been conducted on relationships between
  internalizing problems (INT) and RSB. The current study addresses that literature
  gap, using both a twin sample from Colorado (N = 2567) and a second twin sample
  from Minnesota (N = 1131) in attempt to replicate initial results. We explored the
  hypothesis that the latent variable INT would be more strongly associated with the
  latent variable RSB for females than for males, examining relationships between
  INT and RSB via phenotypic confirmatory factor analysis and multivariate twin analyses.
  We found a small but significant phenotypic association between the latent variables.
  However, despite using two large twin samples, limited power restricted our ability
  to identify the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying this association.
  Our sex differences hypothesis was not fully supported in either sample and requires
  further investigation. Our findings illustrate the complexity of the relationship
  between internalizing problems and risky sexual behavior.
