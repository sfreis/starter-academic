Samantha (Sam) Freis is a predoctoral trainee at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a Ph.D. in Behavioral, Psychiatric, and Statistical Genetics in the Psychology and Neuroscience department.

My interests include using behavioral genetic and geospatial methods to examine research questions focused on genetic and environmental influences on executive functions and their relations to other cognitive functions, psychopathology, substance use, and self-regulation. 

I have a robust data analysis, behavioral science, and research background. In my free time, I enjoy developing and executing data analytics and research projects using open-access and publicly available data. A selection of these projects is hosted on my GitHub: https://github.com/sfreis
